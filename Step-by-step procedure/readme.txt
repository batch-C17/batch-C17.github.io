- Use license_server.lic when asked
- after the installation finishes copy the folders to %installdir% to overwriting the originally installed files

STEP 3: 
The image processing and machine learning techniques are employed in surveillance system of power substation.

STEP 4: 
If the car number are found with the accident detection .The video surveillance system automatically detecting the car number

STEP 5: 
The next step is to sending mail to certain authorities and taking care of first aids.
